"You want to create a game. We plan to develop the backend code for this software using C#. We want to implement new user, sales, and campaign management. You can give the properties of objects as you wish. The aim here is the quality of the code you write. It doesn't matter if you don't fully understand the requirements in the assignment, you can develop your own logic. As I said, we are interested in the quality of the code right now :)

Requirements:

Simulate an environment where players can register for the system, update their information, and delete their registrations. We want to verify the accuracy of customer information using e-government systems. (Verification in e-government systems is done with TCNo, Name, Surname, YearOfBirth information. It is sufficient to simulate the service that will do this.) Â  
Simulate a sales environment where games can be sold. (The sales made should be linked to the player. I mean the player should be a parameter in the method.)
Simulate the ability to enter new campaigns into the system, delete campaigns, and update campaigns.
Simulate campaign integration in sales."

 This is an attempt carried out in this direction.
